TIY Week 9, Day 4: Reverse Polish Calculator

Reverse Polish Calculator project

Hints  
What is "the stack"? The term stack refers to a way of storing/ordering data. You can think of it like a stack of papers/folders. In this assignment you'll only need to interact with the top of the stack: taking items off the top of the stack, doing some calculation, and then putting items back on top of the stack. As you read through the example, you can see that they keep track of what's on the stack. The leftmost number is the "top" of the stack.
